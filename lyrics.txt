[01:00.69] And all the things you do
[01:03.54] 
[01:06.24] And it was called Yellow
[01:10.65] 
[01:13.25] So then I took my turn
[01:17.25] Oh, what a thing to have done
[01:22.48] And it was all yellow

[01:36.72] Turn into something beautiful
[01:42.34] And you know, you know I love you so

[02:53.74] And your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
[02:59.77] Turn into something beautiful
[03:05.35] And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
[03:13.63] For you, I'd bleed myself dry
[03:15.40]
